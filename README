This project provides my personal scripts to install or fully remove multi-
user mode installation of the Nix package manager inside the Ubuntu-18.04
installation.

Official Nix installation URL:
https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-linux

!!!WARNING!!!
Use provided scripts at your own risk!
The removal script removes all Nix related content including the 'nix store'
and its database!
