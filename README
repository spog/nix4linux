This project provides my personal scripts to install and fully remove multi-
user mode installation of the Nix package manager inside Ubuntu-18.04
installation.

Official Nix installation link:
https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-linux

WARNING!
The removal script removes all Nix related content including the 'nix store'.
